Libft - Get next Line 游릭游댮

Evil tests made with 游땓游땓游땓 passion

Context : Create get_next_line(int fd), a function that reads a file
descriptor (int fd) and returns the next line to be read (depends on read from 
unistd.h) in this file descriptor as a string.

Test material
	- a file descriptor pointing to a file or stdin, stdout, stderr

Prototype
	char	*get_next_line(int fd);

BUFFER_SIZE 0 make the program crash as get_next_line(fd) returns NULL in 
that case.

HAPPY PATH SERIES

[游릭] Happy path 1
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile_hp1.txt that contains a least two lines, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Hello everyone,\n'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Glad to see you all again in such good shape :)'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

ZERO NEWLINE SERIES

[游릭] No newline 1
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile_nl1.txt that contains nothing, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] No newline 2
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile_nl1.txt that contains a single character, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'z'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] No newline 3
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile_nl3.txt that contains a few words but still no newline, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] No newline 4
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile_nl4.txt that contains more than a few words but still no
	newline,
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游댮] No newline 5
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile_nl5.txt that contains more than 2000 characters few words,
	but still no newline
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

??? SERIES


[游댮] Small file 
(file of 1 char with a newline)

[游댮] FAT FILE 
(file of 2500 chars)

[游댮] Nothing to read (empty file, file of 0bytes)
(should return NULL)

[游댮] Nothing to read ?
(file  with just a series of newline, no other characters)
(should return NULL)

[游댮] Standard file descriptor 
Test all standard fd (fd >= 0 && fd >= 2)

[游댮] Wrong file descriptor (fd does not exists)
(should return NULL)

[游댮] No human readable file format 
(binary file...?)

[游댮] What, the file has changed between two calls?
