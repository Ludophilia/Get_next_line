Libft - Get next Line ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´

Evil tests made with ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ passion

Context : Create get_next_line(int fd), a function that reads a file
descriptor (int fd) and returns the next line to be read (depends on read from 
unistd.h) in this file descriptor as a string.

Test material
	- a file descriptor pointing to a file or stdin, stdout, stderr

Prototype
	char	*get_next_line(int fd);

[
don't forget to play with the buffer size:
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=0
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=1 (?)
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=10
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=<len of the line to read>
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=42
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=999 (?)
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=1024
	- gcc -D BUFFERSIZE=20230
]

[ðŸŸ¢] Happy path 
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile0.txt that contains a least two lines, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Hello everyone,\n'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Glad to see you all again in such good shape :)'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 0, 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[ðŸ”´] No newline
(open a file that contains just a few words, but no newline, does it work ?)
(open a file that contains just a lot of words, but no newline, does it work ?)

[ðŸ”´] Small file 
(file of 1 char with a newline)
(file of 3 char without a newline)

[ðŸ”´] FAT FILE 
(file of 2500 chars)

[ðŸ”´] Nothing to read (file of 0bytes)
(should return NULL)

[ðŸ”´] Standard file descriptor 
Test all standard fd (fd >= 0 && fd >= 2)

[ðŸ”´] Wrong file descriptor (fd does not exists)
(should return NULL)

[ðŸ”´] No human readable file format 
(binary file...?)

[ðŸ”´] What, the file has changed between two calls?
