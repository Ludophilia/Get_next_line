Libft - Get next Line 🟢🔴

Evil tests made with 😈😈😈

Context : Create get_next_line(int fd), a function that reads a file
descriptor (int fd) and returns the next line to be read (depends on read from 
unistd.h) in this file descriptor as a string.

Test material
	- a file descriptor pointing to a file or stdin, stdout, stderr

Prototype
	char	*get_next_line(int fd);

BUFFER_SIZE 0 make the program crash as get_next_line(fd) returns NULL in 
that case.

Multiple BUFFER_SIZE will be tested throughout this series (1, 10, 16, 42, 999, 
1024, 20230, 10 000 0000 and no -D)

HAPPY PATH SERIES

[🟢] Happy path 1
	- open a testfile that contains a least two lines, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Hello everyone,\n'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Glad to see you all again in such good shape :)'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

NOTHING SERIES

[🟢] Nothing 1 (no newline 1)
	- open a testfile that contains nothing, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] Nothing 2
	- open a testfile that contains a newline and nothing else, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] Nothing 3
	- open a testfile that contains a multiple newlines and nothing else, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

NO NEWLINE SERIES

[🟢] No newline 1
	- open a testfile that contains a single character, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'z'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] No newline 2
	- open a testfile that contains a few words but still no newline, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] No newline 3
	- open a testfile that contains more than a few words but still no
	newline,
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] No newline 4
	- open a testfile that contains more than 2000 characters few words,
	but still no newline
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

NEWLINE SERIES

[🟢] Newline 1
	- open a testfile that contains a character and a newline, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'a'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] Newline 2
	- open a testfile that contains just a character + newline 5 times, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 's\n'
	- get_next_line(fd) on lines 2 to 5
		-> '\n'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] Newline 3
	- open a testfile that contains just a small text that holds on a line + 
	newline 3 times, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> '"Focus!" said the anime swordsman who trained a thousand moons just
		 for this very instant.\n'
	- get_next_line(fd) on lines 2 to 3
		-> '\n'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] Newline 4
	- open a testfile that contains just a small text that holds on n line + 
	no newline at the end, 
	- get_next_line(fd) (lines 1 - 10)
		-> the line with '\n'
	- get_next_line(fd) on line 11
		-> the line
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

[🟢] Newline 5
	- open a testfile that contains a text file of 2500 chars on multiple lines 
	+ 2 newlines at the end)
	- The tests is done on multiple paragraph of the file
	- get_next_line(fd) on a line (characters + '\n')
		-> the characters with '\n'
	- get_next_line(fd) on empty line
		-> '\n'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0

XXXXX SERIES

[🔴] Standard file descriptor 
Test all standard fd (fd >= 0 && fd >= 2)

[🔴] Wrong file descriptor (fd does not exists)
(should return NULL)

XXXXX SERIES

[🔴] No human readable file format 
(binary file...?)

XXXXX SERIES

[🔴] What, the file has changed between two calls?
