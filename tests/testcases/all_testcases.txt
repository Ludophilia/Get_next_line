Libft - Get next Line 游릭游댮

Evil tests made with 游땓游땓游땓

Context : Create get_next_line(int fd), a function that reads a file
descriptor (int fd) and returns the next line to be read (depends on read from 
unistd.h) in this file descriptor as a string.

Test material
	- a file descriptor pointing to a file or stdin, stdout, stderr

Prototype
	char	*get_next_line(int fd);

BUFFER_SIZE 0 make the program crash as get_next_line(fd) returns NULL in 
that case.

HAPPY PATH SERIES

[游릭] Happy path 1
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains a least two lines, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Hello everyone,\n'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'Glad to see you all again in such good shape :)'
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

NOTHING SERIES

[游릭] Nothing 1 (no newline 1)
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains nothing, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] Nothing 2
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains a newline and nothing else, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230,
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] Nothing 3
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains a multiple newlines and nothing else, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230,
		10 000 0000 and no -D

NO NEWLINE SERIES

[游릭] No newline 1
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains a single character, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'z'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] No newline 2
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains a few words but still no newline, 
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] No newline 3
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains more than a few words but still no
	newline,
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

[游릭] No newline 4
	- set BUFFER_SIZE to 1
	- open a testfile that contains more than 2000 characters few words,
	but still no newline
	- get_next_line(fd)
		-> 'this file still has no newline but is a little more verbose :)'
	- every other call to get_next_line(fd)
		-> (char *)0
	- repeat with -D BUFFER_SIZE to 10, 16, 42, 999, 1024, 20230, 
		10 000 0000 and no -D

NEWLINE SERIES

(a file with just a character and newline)
(a file with just a character + newline 5 times)
(a file with just a small text that holds on a line + newline 3 times)
(a file with just a small text that holds on 5 lines + no newline at the end)
(a file with just a text file of 2500 chars  that holds on 15 lines + 3 newlines
at the end)

XXXXX SERIES


[游댮] Standard file descriptor 
Test all standard fd (fd >= 0 && fd >= 2)

[游댮] Wrong file descriptor (fd does not exists)
(should return NULL)

XXXXX SERIES

[游댮] No human readable file format 
(binary file...?)

XXXXX SERIES

[游댮] What, the file has changed between two calls?
